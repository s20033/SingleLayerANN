# SingleLayerANN
The aim of the project is to create a single-layer netowrk to identify the language an input text is written in. The lang.zip file contains a set of texts written in three languages – English, Polish and German. To classify a given text, count the number of occurences of each letter of the latin alphabet. Ignore all other characters – only count the frequencies of the 26 letters of the latin alphabet. For each text, generate a 26-element input vector containing the number of occurences of each letter. Then normalize it: vˆ = v |v| . The output of the network should have local representation: one neuron should be assigned to each language. For a given text only the appropriate neuron should have value 1 and all others 0. To classify an input text, select the neuron with the maximum activation. The discrete (’step’) activation function can be used ( the implementation of the perceptron) or the sigmoid. The lang.test.zip contains the test set to determine accuracy
